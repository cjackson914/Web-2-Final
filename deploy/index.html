            <h2>Why Visit</h2>
            <p>The beloved seasonal park on Penn’s Landing offers visitors the chance to lounge on colorful hammocks, enjoy Philly-inspired eats on floating barges, cool off with craft brews in the beer garden and play games – bocce, shuffleboard and more – along a waterfront boardwalk.</p>
            <p>Day or night, Spruce Street Harbor Park offers excellent options for outdoor recreation and is free and open to the public in the spring through fall.</p>

                                    <p>Over 50 colorful handmade hammocks are strung throughout the park to create a relaxing place to spend summer days and nights. Plus, we have two Hammock Lounges that can be reserved for special events of up to 20 people, featuring premium outdoor seating, standing hammocks, and scenic waterfront views.</p>

                                    <h4>The Oasis</h4>
                                    <p>Located in the Marina at Penn’s Landing, the Oasis consists of three landscaped barges, a net lounge, and floating gardens. The barges feature an ADA-compliant boardwalk, beautiful raw metal railings, and tons of seating. The cantilevered net lounge, inspired by Caribbean resorts, is a place where visitors can relax while suspended 4 feet above the water. The floating gardens are not only aesthetically beautiful, but they also serve to clean the water in the marina.</p>

At the Southern end of the boardwalk, shipping containers have been converted into an arcade with Basket Fever skeeball, air hockey, claw crane games, Ms. Pacman, and two racing games.</p>

                                        <h2>Getting Here</h2>
                                        <p>All of the Delaware River Waterfront and Penn’s Landing is accessible via public transportation, bike and by foot.</p>
                                        <p>To arrive by foot, head to Columbus Boulevard at Spruce Street (just past the Philadelphia Vietnam Veterans Memorial) and you’ve arrived.</p>
                                        <p>By SEPTA, take the Market-Frankford Line to 2nd Street, or numerous SEPTA buses stop at or near Penn’s Landing. By car, look for parking lots located at Lombard Circle, Walnut and Market Streets at Columbus Boulevard. We highly recommend that visitors arrive on foot, by bike (try Indego!) or by public transportation via SEPTA.</p>

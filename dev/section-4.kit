    <h2>Food and Drink</h2>
    <p>Eats and drinks abound at Spruce Street Harbor Park, largely served from cool converted shipping containers that line the boardwalk.</p>
    <p>Menus include classic Boardwalk-inspired fare like burgers and funnel cake, as well as locally hatched goods like Federal Donuts’ fried chicken sandwiches and Chickie’s and Pete’s crab fries, cheesesteaks and more. For dessert, Franklin Fountain always brings its frozen treats (ice cream, custard, milkshakes, floats and more!) to the waterfront.</p>
    <p>Spruce Street Harbor Park has also won awards for being Philly's best beer garden, with three bars serving over fifteen local beers, draft cocktails and wine.</p>

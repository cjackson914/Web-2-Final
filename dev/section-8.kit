            <h2>Getting Here</h2>
            <p>All of the Delaware River Waterfront and Penn’s Landing is accessible via public transportation, bike and by foot.</p>
            <p>To arrive by foot, head to Columbus Boulevard at Spruce Street (just past the Philadelphia Vietnam Veterans Memorial) and you’ve arrived.</p>
            <p>By SEPTA, take the Market-Frankford Line to 2nd Street, or numerous SEPTA buses stop at or near Penn’s Landing. By car, look for parking lots located at Lombard Circle, Walnut and Market Streets at Columbus Boulevard. We highly recommend that visitors arrive on foot, by bike (try Indego!) or by public transportation via SEPTA.</p>

                        <h4>The Oasis</h4>
                        <p>Located in the Marina at Pennâ€™s Landing, the Oasis consists of three landscaped barges, a
                            net lounge, and floating gardens. <span class="show-for-md">The barges feature an
                                ADA-compliant boardwalk, beautiful raw metal railings, and tons of seating. The
                                cantilevered net lounge, inspired by Caribbean resorts, is a place where visitors
                                can relax while suspended 4 feet above the water. The floating gardens are not only
                                aesthetically beautiful, but they also serve to clean the water in the
                                marina.</span></p>

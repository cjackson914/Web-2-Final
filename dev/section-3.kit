                    <h4>The Oasis</h4>
                    <p>Located in the Marina at Pennâ€™s Landing, the Oasis consists of three landscaped barges, a net lounge, and floating gardens. The barges feature an ADA-compliant boardwalk, beautiful raw metal railings, and tons of seating. The cantilevered net lounge, inspired by Caribbean resorts, is a place where visitors can relax while suspended 4 feet above the water. The floating gardens are not only aesthetically beautiful, but they also serve to clean the water in the marina.</p>
